# The Social Psychology of Mobile Communication
## Mobile Communication and Negotiating the Social Expectations of Others
1. fundamental attribution error: Individuals have a tendency to overestimate the role that a person’s personality or disposition plays in determining behavior and underestimate the role that situational factors play in influencing behavior.

## Mobile Co-Presence and the Impact of Mobile Phones on the Field of Social Interaction
1. A fundamental tenet of social psychology is social influence. The presence of known or familiar others reduces anxiety and increases relaxation (de Castro, 1994). 
2. the use of mobile technology as part of the field of social interaction allows for the user to feel as though they have a certain command over what is happening within their sphere of social perception. They may feel as though the remote realm with which they have contact has joined them in their field of social interaction and a type of mobile symbiosis occurs (Cumiskey, 2011). What results is an increased dependency and attachment to those we know and a growing fear and resistance to connecting to those strangers with whom we are face to face.

## Facilitating Social Cohesion through Mobile Communication
We have moved from living in the time and place bounded world to a world where our social networks are mediated. The sum of all our large and small interactions tie us into our social orbits and work to define an augmented field of social interaction. It is through the sum of these interactions (both mediated and direct) that we work out our relationships to our family and friends. Seen in this way, mobile com- munication in its many forms provides new ways to secure these bonds. 

## Multitasking and the Social Psychological Consequences of Split Attention and Mobile-Mediated Social Facilitation
The pace of work and the organization of social life can place a premium of the ability to multitask and yet it is recognized that most people cannot multitask without significant costs.

## Problematic Mobile Phone Use: Exploring Mobile Phone Dependency and Risk-Taking
1. The mobile phone is seen as a convenient way to fill in time when we are, for example, waiting for others while shopping and also as a well-trod link to friends and family.
2. Bayer and Campbell (2012) have used the concept of “automaticity” to describe the degree to which mobile communication and in particular the use of mobile phone becomes automatic. They examine how, for example, checking for texts or mobile Facebook updates is not a conscious activity but rather is “triggered by situational cues and lacks control, awareness, intention, and attention.”
3.  As Ribak (2009) points out, what is important in the tangled web of mobile-mediated relationships is not the actual use of the mobile device but **the potential for contact**: the anticipation of an “important call” 
4. Extensive use of the mobile phone can, in many ways, be compared to the compulsion for shopping, overeating, watching sports, washing our hands, and so on.
5. **Personality factors have been shown to influence how users use their mobile phones (Butt & Phillips, 2008).** When examining the literature for correlates of mobile phone misuse, it was more common among young persons who were extraverted, who had low self-esteem but were not neurotic (Bianchi and Phillips, 2005). These people were also less risk adverse than others. According to the work done in South Korea by Koo (2009), there was lower self-control and a tendency toward impulsiveness among those who misused mobile phones.
