# Snooze! Investigating the User-Defined Deferral of Mobile Notifications

Previous works focus on sending notification in opportune moments. This work instead exploring users' manual deferal of notification.

## Key Points
1. IM & SMS notfications are snoozed the most.
2. Most of the notifications are snoozed and retriggered in the same day.
3. Users snoozed notification that are important but currently unable to attend directly.
4. Users are likely to retrigger notis ar 12:00am 3pm 6pm 9pm (9am in the wild study), which may correspond to the time before and after work, lunchbreak.
5. In controled study, user recieve twice the number of noti on weekends compared to weekdays.
6. Users handle interruption from noti by 
- keep the phone from a distance in addition to silent it 
- uninstall the app
7. Why users want to snooze the noti?
- at work: don't want to deal wth personal noti.
- avoid context switch.
- not in the mood of dealing the noti.
8. delay mechanism:
- **duration** is better in short period of time.
- **point of a time** is better in long distance of time.
