# Conceptualizing Interpersonal Interruption Management: A Theoretical Framework and Research Program

Previous research exploring interpersonal-technology- mediated interruptions has focused on individual's local context. However, this approach has produced limited benefit for users because it fails to take into account **who the interruption is from or what it is about**. The work proposed a framework and research program to provide a complete picture of interruptibility.

## Key points
1. Operationalizing interruptibility in previous work:

* how interruptions impact on task performance and mental workload
    * the mode of interruption
    * method of coordinate of an interruption
    * complexity of interrupted task
    * relevance of interruption to current task
* how interruptions affect one's cognitive/social state and how receptive people are to interruptions
    * self reports of burden/ cost
    * precpetions of value
    * willingness to be interrupted
    * responsiveness to an interruption
2. Predicting Interruptibility
    * current activity of an individual and engangment
    * social situation
3. Interruption Context
    * What is context in "context-aware system"
        * Schilit and Theimer: location, identities of nearby people and objects, and the changes to those objects
        * where you are [or the application], who you are with, and what resources are nearby
        * any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and the applications themselves
        * all aspects between the interrupter and the interruptee including what the interruption is about
        * more richly categorizing the interruption context:
            * Cognitive context
            * Social context
            * Relational context
