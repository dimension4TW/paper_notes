### Keywords:
Notifications; Multi-Device; Mobile; Interruptions

## Key Messages
As more and more devices in the environment could notify the users, we need to understand how users perceive and deal with incoming notifications on multiple device types in their daily lives. 

## Problem Statement
How users cope with the notifications on different devices in their everyday lives.

## Why is it important to solve the problem?
More and more devices in the environment could notify the users.
### Notification on Single Device
- What effect the difficulty of continuing a task after an interruption?
    - primary task
        - complexity
        - duration
    - interruption
        - length
        - numbers
- Meta analysis of nofications
    - Mobile users response to notification within minutes even in silent mode.
    - around 60 notifications per day (2014), and people tend to underestimate the noficatinos they received.  (Weber et al, 2016)
- Besides interruption from notifications, mobile users will self interrupt thenselves to check notifications. (Shamsi T et al, 2010)
- Smart watch (Marta E et al, 2017; Pizza et al, 2016; Visuri et al, 2017)
    - less distruptive
    - able to quickly check whether it is worth it to swich from the primary task

### Notification on Multiple Devices

    - multi-device
    - breakpoint
        - while the device is actively being used
        - physical activity

- challenges
    - distrubution of notifications to different devices

## Experiment and Findings
### Interview
- semi-structured interview
- one researcher lead the interview, another researcher took notes, and a third researcher supervised the procedure
#### Participants
- 16, 8 male 8 female
- aged between 16 and 60 years (M = 30.94, SD = 15.11)
- Six participants were stu- dents of various subjects, four employees, two high school students, two retirees, and two trainees
#### Part 1: General Questions
on which devices they receive notifications in their daily lives
- how many notifications they receive from this devices on a daily basis
- investigation on how participants experience different kinds of notification
    - more useful: communication, calendar events reminders and alarms
    - less useful: system- and security-related notifications
    - depend on content instead on the category
    - all notifications are useful
- When will notifications were disturbing
    - time
        - at night (6 participants)
    - location
        - at work/university/school (5 participants)
    - context
        - during meetings and appointments (3)
    - generally being busy (2)
    - talking to others (1)other people are around them (1)
    - driving (1)
    - during sport (1)
    - being in a bad mood (1)
- notification type
    - ad
    - spammy notification
    - spammy messages
    - notifications from games
    - update notification
    - delivered with sounds
    - notifications unable to be dismissed
    - duplicate notifications
#### Part 2: Device-Specific Questions
usage of their devices and how they cope with notifications on their devices
##### Smartphone
- estimatation about the notifications received
    - Android
        - 5 to 80 notifications (M = 36.15, SD = 16.67) per day
        - 3 to 50 notifications (M = 14.54, SD = 5.77) as relevant
    - iPhone
        - 20 to 50 notifications (M = 36.67, SD = 15.27) per day
        - 20 to 30 notifications M = 26.67, SD = 5.77) are relevant
- check incoming notifications immediately or within a short time span (10)
- silent their phones (2) or put their phone away (1) and check the received notifications manually from time to time
- notification center
    - keep notifications in the notification center to attend or an- swer them later(4)
    - dismiss received notifications immediately to keep the notification center clean (2)
- handeling unwanted notification
    - dismiss these unwanted notifications without changing the notification settings (i.e. deactivate notifications for this app nor uninstall the application)
        - four participants using Android reported that they uninstall such an application directly. After we explained how to revoke the notification permission for apps on Android, three participants reinstalled apps and disabled notifications for them.

#### PC
- desktop computer or laptop with a running a version of Microsoft Windows
- participants estimated that they receive between 0 and 40 notifications (M = 15.16, SD = 11.69) per day
- participants estimated between 0 and 25 notifications (M = 5, 72, SD = 6, 42) as relevant
- participants attend only to notifications generated by specific applications (9)e.g., by mail, calendar, or instant messaging applications
- participants dismiss notification without reading their content (4)
- none of the participants changed the default settings of notifications

#### Tablets
- Five participants owned tablets. Two Android- based tablets (Android 4.3 and 5.1) and three Apple iPads (iOS 9.3.1)
- estimated to use their tablets between 15 and 120 minutes per day (M = 51, SD = 41.89)
- Android
    - receive 2 and 20 notifications per day
    - 0 and 1 notifications (M=0.50, SD=0.71) are relevant
    - most notifications are from games or duplicate email notifications that are already received on other devices
- iPad
    - One iPad user estimated to receive 10 notifications and the other two iPad users mentioned that the amount is similar to smartphone notifications since they are synced

#### Gaming consoles
- Two participants owned a Sony PlayStation 3 and two a PlayStation 4.
- daily usage time be- tween 10 and 120 minutes (M = 47.50, SD = 49.24)
- receive between 0.5 and 10 notifications per day (M = 4.38, SD = 4.19)
    - **low battery warnings for the controller**, online/offline status changes, system updates

## Discussion
- Fewer users configure their notification settings or are aware of the configuration options. 
    - the default configuration of notification settings is an essential challenge for the diverse device types supporting notifications as well as for future notification management systems
    - future devices supporting notifications should also offer options to change the notification settings with less effort


## Insights
- strength
    - the first work to investigate how users handel multi-device notifications with qualitative analysis 
    - pointing out the complex nature of the multi-device notification management and interesting research direction for future works
- weakness
    - method
        - how they anaylzed the data is unclear
            - how many coders? reliability?
        - self report data
        - why not included wearable devices ex. iWatch
    - generalizability
        - participants
            - age range
            - whether they are heavy users of the devices?
            - how long have they been using the devices? stable enough to observe relaiable findings?
    - Why not using field study to observe?
        - not getting enough insights in the qualitative analysis
